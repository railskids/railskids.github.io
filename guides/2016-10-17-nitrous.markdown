# Welcome!!

Hi and welcome to our first Rails Kids setup guide. This guide will help you get set up with Nitrous which a development environment in the cloud. Initially we
will be doing our coding in this environment. We will be here to guide you though all the steps necessary to get you up and running. There are a few
things you need to do so lets get started.

1. Go to the [nitrous website](https://www.nitrous.io/).

2. Sign up for a Nitrous account. There are a few steps to this but hey we are here so shout out if you need a hand. 
Also don't worry if your screen looks a little different, it will be pretty much the same and the steps below will help :)

# Setup Pages

Click the __Signup__ button.

You will be asked to enter a few details (ps you need an email address)

Yay you are now ready to create a project!

## Workspace Setup

Click on the + icon as shown below

The `New Project` page will appear

Lets name your new project _Rails Kids_, and make sure you are creating a __Ruby__ workspace. Then click `Create Project`.

Nitrous will start to create your new Rails Kids workspace. This is exciting but give it a few mins, its doing plenty behind the scenes :)

Nitrous will show you this page while it's creating the new workspace

When its done you'll see this

## Workspace environment

The workspace is made up of a few important areas.

- The file explorer and editor are where we will be spending a lot of time. Choose files to edit using the explorer. They will open in a new tab in the file editor.
- The editor window is where you will write your ruby code.
- The Terminal is used to enter commands to our application.


## Hello World 

From the file explorer window create a new file, right click on the code folder and select new file

In the new file type in the following

`hello 'your name'`

Save the file (by using File -> Save on the menu bar)

In the terminal window type in the following commands

{% highlight sh %}
cd code
irb -I .
require 'hello'
{% endhighlight %}

You should see the terminal window print out what you put in the file! It should look something like this. If you're
stuck just raise your hand. That's what we are here for :)

We know that wasn't very exciting but you've just 
many things

1. You have sucessfully created a nitrous project
**And**
2. You can sucessfully run some ruby code

That's pretty awesome!


# Next Steps
You are up and running with your ruby enviroment. We have a few guides to introduce you to ruby code. They lack the WOW factor
but they are good practise. Once completed we will move onto Rails..and that's much more fun :)
