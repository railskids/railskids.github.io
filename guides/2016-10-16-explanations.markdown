# Explanations
This guide gives very simple explanations for a few common terms you will likely come across. It's not supposed to explain anything in great
detail. But hey just raise your hand if you're not sure, that's why we are here :)

# Ruby
Is an Object Oriented programming language

# Rails
Rails is a web framework.  It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what you 
as the developer need to get started

# Variables
Are used to hold information that may change throughout the life of the program. We will be using them lot in all our tutorials.  


# Gem
Gems are third-party libraries written in ruby. What the really means is they are smnippets of code that someone else has
written and you can use. We like gems :) 

# tabs v's 2 space indentation
This is just a convension of ruby, we like to use 2 space indentation instead of tabs. Its not essential but its good
to start practising

# naming a file 
Another convension in ruby, this time file names are usually in lowercase with underscores to separate if more than one word

# debugging
The steps you take to find a bug in your code. That really means you spend some time trying to figure out
what isn't quite right in your code. There are a few tools that can help you but we will cover these in our tutorials

# Database
A collection of information that is held usually in tables

# MVC
An acronym used to describe a web design pattern. Model, View and Controller

Model - generally represents the database part of the design

View - generally represent the visual layer, i.e. the web page that you see

Controller - generally is the middleman and can communication with both model and the view. 

# REST
REST is a style of web services design that lets you modify resources using one of the HTTP Verbs (there are 4 verbs)
1. GET used to get an existing resource
2. PUT for updating an existing resource
3. POST for creating a new resource
4. DELETE to delete an exiting resource. 
You don't need to know much more than that for the moment :)

# CRUD
Is an acronym for create, read, update and delete. CRUD tells us what operations we can perform on a resource


# API
An API is a back-end application (in contast to a web application that has html pages). An API specifies how software 
components should interact with it.
