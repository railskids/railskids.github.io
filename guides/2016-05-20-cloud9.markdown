# Welcome!!

Hi and welcome to our first Rails Kids guide. This guide will help you get set up with Cloud9 which a development environment in the cloud. Initially we
will be doing our coding in this environment. But don't worry we will be here to guide you though all the steps necessary to get you up and running. There are a few
things you need to do first so lets get started.

1. Go to the [cloud9 website](https://c9.io/).

2. Sign up for a Cloud9 account. There are a few steps to this but don't worry we will guide you through. If you are unsure as an instructor. Also don't worry
if your screen looks a little different. The steps below will help :)

# Setup Pages

Click the __Sign In__ button.

Once you have signed up, you will be shown your dashboard. __Create a New workspace__ by clicking the plus icon.

## Workspace Setup

Name your new workspace _railskids_, and make sure you are creating a __Ruby__ workspace. Then click `Create workspace`.

You will then be taken directly to your new workspace.

## Workspace environment

The workspace is made up of a few important areas.

- The file explorer and editor are where we will be spending a lot of time. Choose files to edit using the explorer. They will open in a new tab in the file editor.
- Run Project Button. We will use this to start and stop our Rails application.
- The Terminal is used to enter commands to our application.

## Set up the text editor

The Ruby global convention is to use 2 spaces for indentation. Lets change the default editor to use 2 spaces.

Click on the Workspace settings icon (shown in the image above) in the upper right side of the window. A preferences window will open edit the __Soft Tabs__ setting to reduce it to 2.

Click on the share button in the top right window. From the __Share this workspace__ window click on the url in Application and select the open option
